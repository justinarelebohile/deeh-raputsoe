	<img src="yess.jpg"> I have a strong work ethic that drives me towards success, this helps me put all the effort and time in what i am doing. I spent  more time doing what i must do, put in overtime if neccessary, rather than giving up before reaching destination. I am always striving to reach my goal through hard work, dedication and perseverance. I am capable of doing something great without expecting something such as pay or praise in return but seccess. I am always looking for challenges like learning new skills,taking a new hobby or traveling to new places

	<img src="bee.jpg"> some may ask is been an ambitious person a good thing? Generally speaking, yes being an ambitious person is a very good thing. It is the drive that pushes us forward to bigger and better things, and it can be contagious. If your friend and family see you working hard and getting great results and not being swayed by any obstaclethat might get in ypur way, then they begin to emulate that behaviour in the hope of achieving the similar result.
