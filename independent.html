	"Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth", I have a strong resolve to overcome life's trials on my own without asking people's interference. I am okay on my own because i do not need anyone's company to be alright...if i do need someone to be good then i will suffer when the same person disappear and move on with their without even thinking twice. Nothing is permanent in this world, do not trust everyone...do not dependent on anyone, do things alone.

<p>
	l am not influenced or controlled by anyone in matters of opinion conduct, " I am not a bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will". Being independent gives me the ability to care for myself, either emotionally, physically or financially. As a result, I am in a better situation to asset others. It increases happiness, promotes asense of belonging, gives you a sense of purpose, and increases my life satisfaction.
