	"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it". I start early and stay late, day after day to get to where i am. I do not practice to get it right, i practice until i can not get it wrong. I am powerful because i am able yo control or influence people, i always expect the best. i believe in my own dreams- if i dream it, i make sure it happens the way it did in my dreams. Nothing shakes me, regardless of the heat or pressure i am in, i stay strong and fight till i achieve what i want.I have a strong work ethic that drives me towards success, this helps me put all the effort and time in what i am doing. I spent  more time doing what i must do, put in overtime if neccessary, rather than giving up before reaching destination. I am always striving to reach my goal through hard work, dedication and perseverance. I am capable of doing something great without expecting something such as pay or praise in return but seccess. I am always looking for challenges like learning new skills,taking a new hobby or traveling to new places

	I have been hurt, humiliated, made to feel small but i defeated them because i am powerful. Some people think i am dominate, some think i am rude... but none of these are the truth. These words actually do not reflect my personality at all, in fact, my personality is often kittens on the inside. I do not have to win, i just do not want to let anyone walk all over me on the outside. some people are afraid of me, but that is because they do not understand how i am so comfortable on my own that i do not need anyone else to validate me. some may ask is been an ambitious person a good thing? Generally speaking, yes being an ambitious person is a very good thing. It is the drive that pushes us forward to bigger and better things, and it can be contagious. If your friend and family see you working hard and getting great results and not being swayed by any obstaclethat might get in ypur way, then they begin to emulate that behaviour in the hope of achieving the similar result.
